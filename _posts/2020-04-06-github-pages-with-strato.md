# How to get GitHub Pages work with a custom domain from strato?

When I was trying to configure the custom domain for my blog on GitHub I got stuck while setting it up via the Github Pages configuration. No error was show and the creation of SSL certificates displayed a progress that never finished. Finally I found a solution which is not straight forward and thats why I described it here for you. The needed configuration may be specific for strato [(www.strato.de)](http://www.strato.de) but may vary/apply to other domain providers as well.


## Configuration on GitHub
Go to the main page of your "GitHub Repository Project" --> "Settings" --> "Pages" and enter your custom domain (e.g. tech-projects.blog).

> BUT, this will not work without the correct configuration on the domain provider side!


## Configuration on Strato

### Domain configuration (e.g. tech-projects.blog)
- Configure the A-Record for your domain and add one of these IPs (IPv4).
```
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

- Configure the AAAA-Record for your domain and add one of these IPs (IPv6).
```
2606:50c0:8000::153
2606:50c0:8001::153
2606:50c0:8002::153
2606:50c0:8003::153
```

### Sub-Domain configuration (e.g. www.tech-projects.blog)
- Add "www." subdomain for your domain.
- Configure the A-Record and add an IP for the subdomain as for the domain.
- Configure the AAAA-Record and add an IP for the subdomain as for the domain.

> Adding the "www." subdomain with an A-Record IP will do the trick here!
