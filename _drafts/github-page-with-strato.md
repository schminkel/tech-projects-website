# How to get GitHub Pages work with a custom domain from strato?

When I was trying to configure the domain for this blog here I got stuck while setting up a custom domain in Github Pages. The solution is not straight forward and thats why I described it here for you. The needed configuration is specific for strato (webhosting provider) but may apply to other providers as well.

## Configuration on GitHub
- "GitHub Repository Project" --> Settings --> Pages

## Configuration on strato
- add subdomain with www.yourdomain.com
- configure A-Record for the subdomain
- configure AAAA-Record for the subdomain

!!! It will stuck when the www. subdomain configuration is missing !!!
